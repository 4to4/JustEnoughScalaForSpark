This notebook teaches you the core concepts of [Scala](http://scala-lang.org) necessary to use [Apache Spark's](http://spark.apache.org) Scala API effectively. Spark does a nice job exploiting the nicest features of Scala, while avoiding most of the more difficult and obscure features. "

    "source" : "## Introduction: Why Scala?\nSpark lets you use Scala, Java, Python, R, and SQL to do your work. Scala and Java appeal to _data engineers_, who do the heavy lifting of building resilient and scalable infrastructures for _Big Data_. Python, R, and SQL appeal to _data scientists_, who build models for analyzing data, including machine learning, as well as explore data interactively, where SQL is very convenient.\n\nThese aren't hard boundaries. Many people do both roles. Many data engineers like Python and may use SQL and R. Many data scientists have decided to use Scala with Spark.\n\nBriefly, some of the advantages of using Scala include the following:\n* **Performance:** Since Spark is written in Scala, you get the best performance and the most complete API coverage when you use Scala. It's true that with [DataFrames](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-programming-guide.html), code written in all five languages performs about the same. If you need to use the [RDD](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/programming-guide.html#resilient-distributed-datasets-rdds) API, then Scala provides the best performance, with Java a close second.\n* **Debugging:** When runtime problems occur, understanding the exception stack frames and other debug information is easiest if you know Scala. Unfortunately, the \"abstraction leaks\" when problems occur.\n* **Concise, Expressive Code:** Compared to Java, Scala code is much more concise and several features of Scala make your code even more concise. This elevates your productivity and makes it easier to imagine a design approach and then write it down without having to translate the idea to a less flexible API that reflects idiomatic language constraints. (You'll see this in action as we go.)\n* **Type Safety:** Compared to Python and R, Scala code benefits from _static typing_ with _type inference_. _Static typing_ means that the Scala parser finds more errors in your expressions at compile time, when they don't match expected types, rather than discovering the problem later at run time. However, _type inference_ means you don't have to add a lot of explicit type information to you code. In most cases, Scala will infer the correct types for you."

    "source" : "### Why Not Scala?\nScala isn't perfect. There are two disadvantages compared to Python and R:\n* **Libraries:** Python and R have a rich ecosystem of data analytics libraries. While the picture is improving for Scala, Python and R are still well ahead.\n* **Advanced Language Features:** Mastering advanced language features gives you a lot of power to exploit, but if you don't understand those features, they can get in your way when you're just trying to get work done. Scala has some sophisticated constructs, especially in its _type system_. Fortunately, Spark mostly hides the advanced constructs."

So, what class is associated with these methods? When you use Scala in a notebook, you're actually using the Scala interpreter, which wraps any expressions and definitions we write into a hidden, generated class. The interpreter has to do this in order to generate valid JVM byte code. \n\n> Unfortunately, it can be a bit confusing when to use a method vs. a function, reflecting Scala's hybrid nature as an object-oriented and a functional language.

Let's explore this a bit more:\n* `val immutableValue = ...`: Once initialized, we can't assign a _different_ value to `immutableValue`.\n* `var mutableVariable = ...`: We can assign new values to `mutableVariable` as often as we want.\n\nIt's _highly recommended_ that you only use `vals` unless you have a good reason for needing mutability, which is a very common source of bugs!!\n\n> A `val immutableValue` could point to an instance that itself _is_ mutable, e.g., an [Array](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/#scala.Array). In this case, while we can't assign a new array to `immutableValue`, we can change elements within the array! Put another way, immutability isn't _transitive_."

In this case, a single type parameter, which represents the type of the records held by the `RDD`. \n\nThe single type parameter is given by `(String,String)`, which is a convenient shorthand for [Tuple2[String,String]](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.Tuple2). That is, we have two-element _tuples_ as records, where the first element is a `String` for a file's fully-qualified path and the second element is a `String` for the contents of that file. This is what `SparkContext.wholeTextFiles` returns for us. We'll use the path to remember where we found words, while the contents contains the words themselves (of course).\n\nTo recap, the following two types are equivalent:\n* `RDD[(String,String)]` - Note parentheses nested in brackets, `[(...)]`.\n* `RDD[Tuple2[String,String]]` - Note nested brackets `[...[...]]`, not `[(...)]`.\n\n> **NOTE:** The number in brackets `[N]` in `MapPartitionsRDD[N]` is actually an internal identifier used by Spark. In the output for `fileContents`, we're actually calling `toString` on the instance. It's confusing that `MapPartitionsRDD.toString` uses `[...]`, which looks like a type signature."

My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and\n\treport speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part,\n\the keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more\n\tproperly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you\n\tthat keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that\n\tdiffers not from the stalling of an ox? His horses\n\tare bred better; for, besides that they are fair\n\twith their feeding, they are taught their manage,\n\tand to that end riders dearly hired: but I, his\n\tbrother, gain nothing under him but growth; for the\n\twhich his animals on his dunghills are as much\n\tbound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so\n\tplentifully gives me, the something that nature gave\n\tme his countenance seems to take from me: he lets\n\tme feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a\n\tbrother, and, as much as in him lies, mines my\n\tgentility with my education. This is it, Adam, that\n\tgrieves me; and the spirit of my father, which I\n\tthink is within me, begins to mutiny against this\n\tservitude: I will no longer endure it, though yet I\n\tknow no wise remedy how to avoid it.\n\nADAM\tYonder comes my master, your brother.\n\nORLANDO\tGo apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he will\n\tshake me up.\n\n\t[Enter OLIVER]\n\nOLIVER\tNow, sir! what make you here?\n\nORLANDO\tNothing: I am not taught to make any thing.\n\nOLIVER\tWhat mar you then, sir?\n\nORLANDO\tMarry, sir, I am helping you to mar that which God\n\tmade, a poor unworthy brother of yours, with idleness.\n\nOLIVER\tMarry, sir, be better employed, and be naught awhile.\n\nORLANDO\tShall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them?\n\tWhat prodigal portion have I spent, that I should\n\tcome to such penury?\n\nOLIVER\tKnow you where your are, sir?\n\nORLANDO\tO, sir, very well; here in your orchard.\n\nOLIVER\tKnow you before whom, sir?\n\nORLANDO\tAy, better than him I am before knows me. I know\n\tyou are my eldest brother; and, in the gentle\n\tcondition of blood, you should so know me. The\n\tcourtesy of nations allows you my better, in that\n\tyou are the first-born; but the same tradition\n\ttakes not away my blood, were there twenty brothers\n\tbetwixt us: I have as much of my father in me as\n\tyou; albeit, I confess, your coming before me is\n\tnearer to his reverence.\n\nOLIVER\tWhat, boy!\n\nORLANDO\tCome, come, elder brother, you are too young in this.\n\nOLIVER\tWilt thou lay hands on me, villain?\n\nORLANDO\tI am no villain; I am the youngest son of Sir\n\tRowland de Boys; he was my father, and he is thrice\n\ta villain that says such a father begot villains.\n\tWert thou not my brother, I would not take this hand\n\tfrom thy throat till this other had pulled out thy\n\ttongue for saying so: thou hast railed on thyself.\n\nADAM\tSweet masters, be patient: for your father's\n\tremembrance, be at accord.\n\nOLIVER\tLet me go, I say.\n\nORLANDO\tI will not, till I please: you shall hear me. My\n\tfather charged you in his will to give me good\n\teducation: you have trained me like a peasant,\n\tobscuring and hiding from me all gentleman-like\n\tqualities. The spirit of my father grows strong in\n\tme, and I will no longer endure it: therefore allow\n\tme such exercises as may become a gentleman, or\n\tgive me the poor allottery my father left me by\n\ttestament; with that I will go buy my fortunes.\n\nOLIVER\tAnd what wilt thou do? beg, when that is spent?\n\tWell, sir, get you in: I will not long be troubled\n\twith you; you shall have some part of your will: I\n\tpray you, leave me.\n\nORLANDO\tI will no further offend you than becomes me for my good.\n\nOLIVER\tGet you with him, you old dog.\n\nADAM\tIs 'old dog' my reward?

She is at the court, and no\n\tless beloved of her uncle than his own daughter; and\n\tnever two ladies loved as they do.\n\nOLIVER\tWhere will the old duke live?\n\nCHARLES\tThey say he is already in the forest of Arden, and\n\ta many merry men with him; and there they live like\n\tthe old Robin Hood of England: they say many young\n\tgentlemen flock to him every day, and fleet the time\n\tcarelessly, as they did in the golden world.\n\nOLIVER\tWhat, you wrestle to-morrow before the new duke?\n\nCHARLES\tMarry, do I, sir; and I came to acquaint you with a\n\tmatter. I am given, sir, secretly to understand\n\tthat your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition\n\tto come in disguised against me to try a fall.\n\tTo-morrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit; and he that\n\tescapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him\n\twell. Your brother is but young and tender; and,\n\tfor your love, I would be loath to foil him, as I\n\tmust, for my own honour, if he come in: therefore,\n\tout of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint you\n\twithal, that either you might stay him from his\n\tintendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall\n\trun into, in that it is a thing of his own search\n\tand altogether against my will.\n\nOLIVER\tCharles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which\n\tthou shalt find I will most kindly requite. I had\n\tmyself notice of my brother's purpose herein and\n\thave by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from\n\tit, but he is resolute. I'll tell thee, Charles:\n\tit is the stubbornest young fellow of France, full\n\tof ambition, an envious emulator of every man's\n\tgood parts, a secret and villanous contriver against\n\tme his natural brother: therefore use thy\n\tdiscretion; I had as lief thou didst break his neck\n\tas his finger. And thou wert best look to't; for if\n\tthou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not\n\tmightily grace himself on thee, he will practise\n\tagainst thee by poison, entrap thee by some\n\ttreacherous device and never leave thee till he\n\thath ta'en thy life by some indirect means or other;\n\tfor, I assure thee, and almost with tears I speak\n\tit, there is not one so young and so villanous this\n\tday living. I speak but brotherly of him; but\n\tshould I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must\n\tblush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder.\n\nCHARLES\tI am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come\n\tto-morrow, I'll give him his payment: if ever he go\n\talone again, I'll never wrestle for prize more: and\n\tso God keep your worship!\n\nOLIVER\tFarewell, good Charles.\n\n\t[Exit CHARLES]\n\n\tNow will I stir this gamester: I hope I shall see\n\tan end of him; for my soul, yet I know not why,\n\thates nothing more than he. Yet he's gentle, never\n\tschooled and yet learned, full of noble device, of\n\tall sorts enchantingly beloved, and indeed so much\n\tin the heart of the world, and especially of my own\n\tpeople, who best know him, that I am altogether\n\tmisprised: but it shall not be so long; this\n\twrestler shall clear all: nothing remains but that\n\tI kindle the boy thither; which now I'll go about.\n\n\t[Exit]\n\n\n\n\n\tAS YOU LIKE IT\n\n\nACT I\n\n\n\nSCENE II\tLawn before the Duke's palace.\n\n\n\t[Enter CELIA and ROSALIND]\n\nCELIA\tI pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.\n\nROSALIND\tDear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of;\n\tand would you yet I were merrier?

In respect that it is solitary, I\n\tlike it very well; but in respect that it is\n\tprivate, it is a very vile life. Now, in respect it\n\tis in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but in\n\trespect it is not in the court, it is tedious. As\n\tis it a spare life, look you, it fits my humour well;\n\tbut as there is no more plenty in it, it goes much\n\tagainst my stomach. Hast any philosophy in thee, shepherd?\n\nCORIN\tNo more but that I know the more one sickens the\n\tworse at ease he is; and that he that wants money,\n\tmeans and content is without three good friends;\n\tthat the property of rain is to wet and fire to\n\tburn; that good pasture makes fat sheep, and that a\n\tgreat cause of the night is lack of the sun; that\n\the that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may\n\tcomplain of good breeding or comes of a very dull kindred.\n\nTOUCHSTONE\tSuch a one is a natural philosopher.

There is a man haunts the forest, that\n\tabuses our young plants with carving 'Rosalind' on\n\ttheir barks; hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies\n\ton brambles, all, forsooth, deifying the name of\n\tRosalind: if I could meet that fancy-monger I would\n\tgive him some good counsel, for he seems to have the\n\tquotidian of love upon him.\n\nORLANDO\tI am he that is so love-shaked: I pray you tell me\n\tyour remedy.\n\nROSALIND\tThere is none of my uncle's marks upon you: he\n\ttaught me how to know a man in love; in which cage\n\tof rushes I am sure you are not prisoner.\n\nORLANDO\tWhat were his marks?\n\nROSALIND\tA lean cheek, which you have not, a blue eye and\n\tsunken, which you have not, an unquestionable\n\tspirit, which you have not, a beard neglected,\n\twhich you have not; but I pardon you for that, for\n\tsimply your having in beard is a younger brother's\n\trevenue: then your hose should be ungartered, your\n\tbonnet unbanded, your sleeve unbuttoned, your shoe\n\tuntied and every thing about you demonstrating a\n\tcareless desolation; but you are no such man; you\n\tare rather point-device in your accoutrements as\n\tloving yourself than seeming the lover of any other.\n\nORLANDO\tFair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love.\n\nROSALIND\tMe believe it! you may as soon make her that you\n\tlove believe it; which, I warrant, she is apter to\n\tdo than to confess she does: that is one of the\n\tpoints in the which women still give the lie to\n\ttheir consciences.

Yet I profess curing it by counsel.\n\nORLANDO\tDid you ever cure any so?\n\nROSALIND\tYes, one, and in this manner. He was to imagine me\n\this love, his mistress; and I set him every day to\n\twoo me: at which time would I, being but a moonish\n\tyouth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing\n\tand liking, proud, fantastical, apish, shallow,\n\tinconstant, full of tears, full of smiles, for every\n\tpassion something and for no passion truly any\n\tthing, as boys and women are for the most part\n\tcattle of this colour; would now like him, now loathe\n\thim; then entertain him, then forswear him; now weep\n\tfor him, then spit at him; that I drave my suitor\n\tfrom his mad humour of love to a living humour of\n\tmadness; which was, to forswear the full stream of\n\tthe world, and to live in a nook merely monastic.\n\tAnd thus I cured him; and this way will I take upon\n\tme to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's\n\theart, that there shall not be one spot of love in't.\n\nORLANDO\tI would not be cured, youth.\n\nROSALIND\tI would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind\n\tand come every day to my cote and woo me.\n\nORLANDO\tNow, by the faith of my love, I will: tell me\n\twhere it is.\n\nROSALIND\tGo with me to it and I'll show it you and by the way\n\tyou shall tell me where in the forest you live.\n\tWill you go?\n\nORLANDO\tWith all my heart, good youth.\n\nROSALIND\tNay you must call me Rosalind.

But whatsoever I have\n\tmerited, either in my mind or, in my means, meed,\n\tI am sure, I have received none; unless experience\n\tbe a jewel that I have purchased at an infinite\n\trate, and that hath taught me to say this:\n\n\t'Love like a shadow flies when substance love pursues;\n\tPursuing that that flies, and flying what pursues.'\n\nFALSTAFF\tHave you received no promise of satisfaction at her hands?\n\nFORD\tNever.\n\nFALSTAFF\tHave you importuned her to such a purpose?\n\nFORD\tNever.\n\nFALSTAFF\tOf what quality was your love, then?\n\nFORD\tLike a fair house built on another man's ground; so\n\tthat I have lost my edifice by mistaking the place\n\twhere I erected it.\n\nFALSTAFF\tTo what purpose have you unfolded this to me?\n\nFORD\tWhen I have told you that, I have told you all.\n\tSome say, that though she appear honest to me, yet in\n\tother places she enlargeth her mirth so far that\n\tthere is shrewd construction made of her. Now, Sir\n\tJohn, here is the heart of my purpose: you are a\n\tgentleman of excellent breeding, admirable\n\tdiscourse, of great admittance, authentic in your\n\tplace and person, generally allowed for your many\n\twar-like, court-like, and learned preparations.\n\nFALSTAFF\tO, sir!\n\nFORD\tBelieve it, for you know it. There is money; spend\n\tit, spend it; spend more; spend all I have; only\n\tgive me so much of your time in exchange of it, as\n\tto lay an amiable siege to the honesty of this\n\tFord's wife: use your art of wooing; win her to\n\tconsent to you: if any man may, you may as soon as\n\tany.\n\nFALSTAFF\tWould it apply well to the vehemency of your\n\taffection, that I should win what you would enjoy?\n\tMethinks you prescribe to yourself very preposterously.\n\nFORD\tO, understand my drift.

What say you to't, Sir John?\n\nFALSTAFF\tMaster Brook, I will first make bold with your\n\tmoney; next, give me your hand; and last, as I am a\n\tgentleman, you shall, if you will, enjoy Ford's wife.\n\nFORD\tO good sir!\n\nFALSTAFF\tI say you shall.\n\nFORD\tWant no money, Sir John; you shall want none.\n\nFALSTAFF\tWant no Mistress Ford, Master Brook; you shall want\n\tnone.

The rogues\n\tslighted me into the river with as little remorse as\n\tthey would have drowned a blind bitch's puppies,\n\tfifteen i' the litter: and you may know by my size\n\tthat I have a kind of alacrity in sinking; if the\n\tbottom were as deep as hell, I should down.

Did she change her determination?\n\nFALSTAFF\tNo, Master Brook; but the peaking Cornuto her\n\thusband, Master Brook, dwelling in a continual\n\t'larum of jealousy, comes me in the instant of our\n\tencounter, after we had embraced, kissed, protested,\n\tand, as it were, spoke the prologue of our comedy;\n\tand at his heels a rabble of his companions, thither\n\tprovoked and instigated by his distemper, and,\n\tforsooth, to search his house for his wife's love.\n\nFORD\tWhat, while you were there?\n\nFALSTAFF\tWhile I was there.\n\nFORD\tAnd did he search for you, and could not find you?\n\nFALSTAFF\tYou shall hear. As good luck would have it, comes\n\tin one Mistress Page; gives intelligence of Ford's\n\tapproach; and, in her invention and Ford's wife's\n\tdistraction, they conveyed me into a buck-basket.\n\nFORD\tA buck-basket!\n\nFALSTAFF\tBy the Lord, a buck-basket! rammed me in with foul\n\tshirts and smocks, socks, foul stockings, greasy\n\tnapkins; that, Master Brook, there was the rankest\n\tcompound of villanous smell that ever offended nostril.\n\nFORD\tAnd how long lay you there?\n\nFALSTAFF\tNay, you shall hear, Master Brook, what I have\n\tsuffered to bring this woman to evil for your good.\n\tBeing thus crammed in the basket, a couple of Ford's\n\tknaves, his hinds, were called forth by their\n\tmistress to carry me in the name of foul clothes to\n\tDatchet-lane: they took me on their shoulders; met\n\tthe jealous knave their master in the door, who\n\tasked them once or twice what they had in their\n\tbasket: I quaked for fear, lest the lunatic knave\n\twould have searched it; but fate, ordaining he\n\tshould be a cuckold, held his hand. Well: on went he\n\tfor a search, and away went I for foul clothes. But\n\tmark the sequel, Master Brook: I suffered the pangs\n\tof three several deaths; first, an intolerable\n\tfright, to be detected with a jealous rotten\n\tbell-wether; next, to be compassed, like a good\n\tbilbo, in the circumference of a peck, hilt to\n\tpoint, heel to head; and then, to be stopped in,\n\tlike a strong distillation, with stinking clothes\n\tthat fretted in their own grease: think of that,--a\n\tman of my kidney,--think of that,--that am as subject\n\tto heat as butter; a man of continual dissolution\n\tand thaw: it was a miracle to scape suffocation.\n\tAnd in the height of this bath, when I was more than\n\thalf stewed in grease, like a Dutch dish, to be\n\tthrown into the Thames, and cooled, glowing hot,\n\tin that surge, like a horse-shoe; think of\n\tthat,--hissing hot,--think of that, Master Brook.\n\nFORD\tIn good sadness, I am sorry that for my sake you\n\thave sufferd all this. My suit then is desperate;\n\tyou'll undertake her no more?\n\nFALSTAFF\tMaster Brook, I will be thrown into Etna, as I have\n\tbeen into Thames, ere I will leave her thus. Her\n\thusband is this morning gone a-birding: I have\n\treceived from her another embassy of meeting; 'twixt\n\teight and nine is the hour, Master Brook.\n\nFORD\t'Tis past eight already, sir.\n\nFALSTAFF\tIs it? I will then address me to my appointment.\n\tCome to me at your convenient leisure, and you shall\n\tknow how I speed; and the conclusion shall be\n\tcrowned with your enjoying her. Adieu. You shall\n\thave her, Master Brook; Master Brook, you shall\n\tcuckold Ford.\n\n\t[Exit]\n\nFORD\tHum! ha! is this a vision? is this a dream? do I\n\tsleep? Master Ford awake! awake, Master Ford!\n\tthere's a hole made in your best coat, Master Ford.\n\tThis 'tis to be married! this 'tis to have linen\n\tand buck-baskets! Well, I will proclaim myself\n\twhat I am: I will now take the lecher; he is at my\n\thouse; he cannot 'scape me; 'tis impossible he\n\tshould; he cannot creep into a halfpenny purse,\n\tnor into a pepper-box: but, lest the devil that\n\tguides him should aid him, I will search\n\timpossible places.

Name what part I am for, and proceed.\n\nQUINCE\tYou, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus.\n\nBOTTOM\tWhat is Pyramus? a lover, or a tyrant?\n\nQUINCE\tA lover, that kills himself most gallant for love.\n\nBOTTOM\tThat will ask some tears in the true performing of\n\tit: if I do it, let the audience look to their\n\teyes; I will move storms, I will condole in some\n\tmeasure. To the rest: yet my chief humour is for a\n\ttyrant: I could play Ercles rarely, or a part to\n\ttear a cat in, to make all split.\n\tThe raging rocks\n\tAnd shivering shocks\n\tShall break the locks\n\tOf prison gates;\n\tAnd Phibbus' car\n\tShall shine from far\n\tAnd make and mar\n\tThe foolish Fates.\n\tThis was lofty! Now name the rest of the players.\n\tThis is Ercles' vein, a tyrant's vein; a lover is\n\tmore condoling.\n\nQUINCE\tFrancis Flute, the bellows-mender.\n\nFLUTE\tHere, Peter Quince.\n\nQUINCE\tFlute, you must take Thisby on you.\n\nFLUTE\tWhat is Thisby? a wandering knight?\n\nQUINCE\tIt is the lady that Pyramus must love.\n\nFLUTE\tNay, faith, let me not play a woman; I have a beard coming.\n\nQUINCE\tThat's all one: you shall play it in a mask, and\n\tyou may speak as small as you will.\n\nBOTTOM\tAn I may hide my face, let me play Thisby too, I'll\n\tspeak in a monstrous little voice. 'Thisne,\n\tThisne;' 'Ah, Pyramus, lover dear! thy Thisby dear,\n\tand lady dear!'\n\nQUINCE\tNo, no; you must play Pyramus: and, Flute, you Thisby.\n\nBOTTOM\tWell, proceed.\n\nQUINCE\tRobin Starveling, the tailor.\n\nSTARVELING\tHere, Peter Quince.\n\nQUINCE\tRobin Starveling, you must play Thisby's mother.\n\tTom Snout, the tinker.\n\nSNOUT\tHere, Peter Quince.\n\nQUINCE\tYou, Pyramus' father: myself, Thisby's father:\n\tSnug, the joiner; you, the lion's part: and, I\n\thope, here is a play fitted.\n\nSNUG\tHave you the lion's part written? pray you, if it\n\tbe, give it me, for I am slow of study.\n\nQUINCE\tYou may do it extempore, for it is nothing but roaring.\n\nBOTTOM\tLet me play the lion too: I will roar, that I will\n\tdo any man's heart good to hear me; I will roar,\n\tthat I will make the duke say 'Let him roar again,\n\tlet him roar again.'\n\nQUINCE\tAn you should do it too terribly, you would fright\n\tthe duchess and the ladies, that they would shriek;\n\tand that were enough to hang us all.\n\nALL\tThat would hang us, every mother's son.\n\nBOTTOM\tI grant you, friends, if that you should fright the\n\tladies out of their wits, they would have no more\n\tdiscretion but to hang us: but I will aggravate my\n\tvoice so that I will roar you as gently as any\n\tsucking dove; I will roar you an 'twere any\n\tnightingale.\n\nQUINCE\tYou can play no part but Pyramus; for Pyramus is a\n\tsweet-faced man; a proper man, as one shall see in a\n\tsummer's day; a most lovely gentleman-like man:\n\ttherefore you must needs play Pyramus.\n\nBOTTOM\tWell, I will undertake it. What beard were I best\n\tto play it in?\n\nQUINCE\tWhy, what you will.\n\nBOTTOM\tI will discharge it in either your straw-colour\n\tbeard, your orange-tawny beard, your purple-in-grain\n\tbeard, or your French-crown-colour beard, your\n\tperfect yellow.\n\nQUINCE\tSome of your French crowns have no hair at all, and\n\tthen you will play bare-faced. But, masters, here\n\tare your parts: and I am to entreat you, request\n\tyou and desire you, to con them by to-morrow night;\n\tand meet me in the palace wood, a mile without the\n\ttown, by moonlight; there will we rehearse, for if\n\twe meet in the city, we shall be dogged with\n\tcompany, and our devices known. In the meantime I\n\twill draw a bill of properties, such as our play\n\twants. I pray you, fail me not.\n\nBOTTOM\tWe will meet; and there we may rehearse most\n\tobscenely and courageously.

This green plot shall be our\n\tstage, this hawthorn-brake our tiring-house; and we\n\twill do it in action as we will do it before the duke.\n\nBOTTOM\tPeter Quince,--\n\nQUINCE\tWhat sayest thou, bully Bottom?\n\nBOTTOM\tThere are things in this comedy of Pyramus and\n\tThisby that will never please. First, Pyramus must\n\tdraw a sword to kill himself; which the ladies\n\tcannot abide. How answer you that?\n\nSNOUT\tBy'r lakin, a parlous fear.\n\nSTARVELING\tI believe we must leave the killing out, when all is done.\n\nBOTTOM\tNot a whit: I have a device to make all well.\n\tWrite me a prologue; and let the prologue seem to\n\tsay, we will do no harm with our swords, and that\n\tPyramus is not killed indeed; and, for the more\n\tbetter assurance, tell them that I, Pyramus, am not\n\tPyramus, but Bottom the weaver: this will put them\n\tout of fear.\n\nQUINCE\tWell, we will have such a prologue; and it shall be\n\twritten in eight and six.\n\nBOTTOM\tNo, make it two more; let it be written in eight and eight.\n\nSNOUT\tWill not the ladies be afeard of the lion?\n\nSTARVELING\tI fear it, I promise you.\n\nBOTTOM\tMasters, you ought to consider with yourselves: to\n\tbring in--God shield us!--a lion among ladies, is a\n\tmost dreadful thing; for there is not a more fearful\n\twild-fowl than your lion living; and we ought to\n\tlook to 't.\n\nSNOUT\tTherefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion.\n\nBOTTOM\tNay, you must name his name, and half his face must\n\tbe seen through the lion's neck: and he himself\n\tmust speak through, saying thus, or to the same\n\tdefect,--'Ladies,'--or 'Fair-ladies--I would wish\n\tYou,'--or 'I would request you,'--or 'I would\n\tentreat you,--not to fear, not to tremble: my life\n\tfor yours. If you think I come hither as a lion, it\n\twere pity of my life: no I am no such thing; I am a\n\tman as other men are;' and there indeed let him name\n\this name, and tell them plainly he is Snug the joiner.\n\nQUINCE\tWell it shall be so. But there is two hard things;\n\tthat is, to bring the moonlight into a chamber; for,\n\tyou know, Pyramus and Thisby meet by moonlight.\n\nSNOUT\tDoth the moon shine that night we play our play?\n\nBOTTOM\tA calendar, a calendar! look in the almanac; find\n\tout moonshine, find out moonshine.\n\nQUINCE\tYes, it doth shine that night.\n\nBOTTOM\tWhy, then may you leave a casement of the great\n\tchamber window, where we play, open, and the moon\n\tmay shine in at the casement.\n\nQUINCE\tAy; or else one must come in with a bush of thorns\n\tand a lanthorn, and say he comes to disfigure, or to\n\tpresent, the person of Moonshine. Then, there is\n\tanother thing: we must have a wall in the great\n\tchamber; for Pyramus and Thisby says the story, did\n\ttalk through the chink of a wall.\n\nSNOUT\tYou can never bring in a wall. What say you, Bottom?\n\nBOTTOM\tSome man or other must present Wall: and let him\n\thave some plaster, or some loam, or some rough-cast\n\tabout him, to signify wall; and let him hold his\n\tfingers thus, and through that cranny shall Pyramus\n\tand Thisby whisper.\n\nQUINCE\tIf that may be, then all is well. Come, sit down,\n\tevery mother's son, and rehearse your parts.\n\tPyramus, you begin: when you have spoken your\n\tspeech, enter into that brake: and so every one\n\taccording to his cue.\n\n\t[Enter PUCK behind]\n\nPUCK\tWhat hempen home-spuns have we swaggering here,\n\tSo near the cradle of the fairy queen?\n\tWhat, a play toward!

Trust me, sweet,\n\tOut of this silence yet I pick'd a welcome;\n\tAnd in the modesty of fearful duty\n\tI read as much as from the rattling tongue\n\tOf saucy and audacious eloquence.\n\tLove, therefore, and tongue-tied simplicity\n\tIn least speak most, to my capacity.\n\n\t[Re-enter PHILOSTRATE]\n\nPHILOSTRATE\tSo please your grace, the Prologue is address'd.\n\nTHESEUS\tLet him approach.\n\n\t[Flourish of trumpets]\n\n\t[Enter QUINCE for the Prologue]\n\nPrologue\tIf we offend, it is with our good will.\n\tThat you should think, we come not to offend,\n\tBut with good will.

A good moral, my lord: it is not\n\tenough to speak, but to speak true.\n\nHIPPOLYTA\tIndeed he hath played on his prologue like a child\n\ton a recorder; a sound, but not in government.\n\nTHESEUS\tHis speech, was like a tangled chain; nothing\n\timpaired, but all disordered. Who is next?\n\n\t[Enter Pyramus and Thisbe, Wall, Moonshine, and Lion]\n\nPrologue\tGentles, perchance you wonder at this show;\n\tBut wonder on, till truth make all things plain.\n\tThis man is Pyramus, if you would know;\n\tThis beauteous lady Thisby is certain.\n\tThis man, with lime and rough-cast, doth present\n\tWall, that vile Wall which did these lovers sunder;\n\tAnd through Wall's chink, poor souls, they are content\n\tTo whisper. At the which let no man wonder.\n\tThis man, with lanthorn, dog, and bush of thorn,\n\tPresenteth Moonshine; for, if you will know,\n\tBy moonshine did these lovers think no scorn\n\tTo meet at Ninus' tomb, there, there to woo.\n\tThis grisly beast, which Lion hight by name,\n\tThe trusty Thisby, coming first by night,\n\tDid scare away, or rather did affright;\n\tAnd, as she fled, her mantle she did fall,\n\tWhich Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain.\n\tAnon comes Pyramus, sweet youth and tall,\n\tAnd finds his trusty Thisby's mantle slain:\n\tWhereat, with blade, with bloody blameful blade,\n\tHe bravely broach'd is boiling bloody breast;\n\tAnd Thisby, tarrying in mulberry shade,\n\tHis dagger drew, and died. For all the rest,\n\tLet Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twain\n\tAt large discourse, while here they do remain.\n\n\t[Exeunt Prologue, Thisbe, Lion, and Moonshine]\n\nTHESEUS\tI wonder if the lion be to speak.\n\nDEMETRIUS\tNo wonder, my lord: one lion may, when many asses do.\n\nWall\tIn this same interlude it doth befall\n\tThat I, one Snout by name, present a wall;\n\tAnd such a wall, as I would have you think,\n\tThat had in it a crannied hole or chink,\n\tThrough which the lovers, Pyramus and Thisby,\n\tDid whisper often very secretly.\n\tThis loam, this rough-cast and this stone doth show\n\tThat I am that same wall; the truth is so:\n\tAnd this the cranny is, right and sinister,\n\tThrough which the fearful lovers are to whisper.\n\nTHESEUS\tWould you desire lime and hair to speak better?\n\nDEMETRIUS\tIt is the wittiest partition that ever I heard\n\tdiscourse, my lord.\n\n\t[Enter Pyramus]\n\nTHESEUS\tPyramus draws near the wall: silence!\n\nPyramus\tO grim-look'd night! O night with hue so black!\n\tO night, which ever art when day is not!\n\tO night, O night! alack, alack, alack,\n\tI fear my Thisby's promise is forgot!\n\tAnd thou, O wall, O sweet, O lovely wall,\n\tThat stand'st between her father's ground and mine!\n\tThou wall, O wall, O sweet and lovely wall,\n\tShow me thy chink, to blink through with mine eyne!\n\n\t[Wall holds up his fingers]\n\n\tThanks, courteous wall: Jove shield thee well for this!\n\tBut what see I? No Thisby do I see.\n\tO wicked wall, through whom I see no bliss!\n\tCursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me!\n\nTHESEUS\tThe wall, methinks, being sensible, should curse again.\n\nPyramus\tNo, in truth, sir, he should not. 'Deceiving me'\n\tis Thisby's cue: she is to enter now, and I am to\n\tspy her through the wall. You shall see, it will\n\tfall pat as I told you. Yonder she comes.\n\n\t[Enter Thisbe]\n\nThisbe\tO wall, full often hast thou heard my moans,\n\tFor parting my fair Pyramus and me!\n\tMy cherry lips have often kiss'd thy stones,\n\tThy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee.\n\nPyramus\tI see a voice: now will I to the chink,\n\tTo spy an I can hear my Thisby's face. Thisby!\n\nThisbe\tMy love thou art, my love I think.\n\nPyramus\tThink what thou wilt, I am thy lover's grace;\n\tAnd, like Limander, am I trusty still.\n\nThisbe\tAnd I like Helen, till the Fates me kill.\n\nPyramus\tNot Shafalus to Procrus was so true.\n\nThisbe\tAs Shafalus to Procrus, I to you.\n\nPyramus\tO kiss me through the hole of this vile wall!\n\nThisbe\tI kiss the wall's hole, not your lips at all.\n\nPyramus\tWilt thou at Ninny's tomb meet me straightway?\n\nThisbe\t'Tide life, 'tide death, I come without delay.\n\n\t[Exeunt Pyramus and Thisbe]\n\nWall\tThus have I, Wall, my part discharged so;\n\tAnd, being done, thus Wall away doth go.\n\n\t[Exit]\n\nTHESEUS\tNow is the mural down between the two neighbours.\n\nDEMETRIUS\tNo remedy, my lord, when walls are so wilful to hear\n\twithout warning.\n\nHIPPOLYTA\tThis is the silliest stuff that ever I heard.\n\nTHESEUS\tThe best in this kind are but shadows; and the worst\n\tare no worse, if imagination amend them.\n\nHIPPOLYTA\tIt must be your imagination then, and not theirs.\n\nTHESEUS\tIf we imagine no worse of them than they of\n\tthemselves, they may pass for excellent men. Here\n\tcome two noble beasts in, a man and a lion.\n\n\t[Enter Lion and Moonshine]\n\nLion\tYou, ladies, you, whose gentle hearts do fear\n\tThe smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor,\n\tMay now perchance both quake and tremble here,\n\tWhen lion rough in wildest rage doth roar.\n\tThen know that I, one Snug the joiner, am\n\tA lion-fell, nor else no lion's dam;\n\tFor, if I should as lion come in strife\n\tInto this place, 'twere pity on my life.\n\nTHESEUS\tA very gentle beast, of a good conscience.\n\nDEMETRIUS\tThe very best at a beast, my lord, that e'er I saw.\n\nLYSANDER\tThis lion is a very fox for his valour.\n\nTHESEUS\tTrue; and a goose for his discretion.\n\nDEMETRIUS\tNot so, my lord; for his valour cannot carry his\n\tdiscretion; and the fox carries the goose.\n\nTHESEUS\tHis discretion, I am sure, cannot carry his valour;\n\tfor the goose carries not the fox. It is well:\n\tleave it to his discretion, and let us listen to the moon.\n\nMoonshine\tThis lanthorn doth the horned moon present;--\n\nDEMETRIUS\tHe should have worn the horns on his head.\n\nTHESEUS\tHe is no crescent, and his horns are\n\tinvisible within the circumference.\n\nMoonshine\tThis lanthorn doth the horned moon present;\n\tMyself the man i' the moon do seem to be.\n\nTHESEUS\tThis is the greatest error of all the rest: the man\n\tshould be put into the lanthorn. How is it else the\n\tman i' the moon?\n\nDEMETRIUS\tHe dares not come there for the candle; for, you\n\tsee, it is already in snuff.\n\nHIPPOLYTA\tI am aweary of this moon: would he would change!\n\nTHESEUS\tIt appears, by his small light of discretion, that\n\the is in the wane; but yet, in courtesy, in all\n\treason, we must stay the time.\n\nLYSANDER\tProceed, Moon.\n\nMoonshine\tAll that I have to say, is, to tell you that the\n\tlanthorn is the moon; I, the man in the moon; this\n\tthorn-bush, my thorn-bush; and this dog, my dog.\n\nDEMETRIUS\tWhy, all these should be in the lanthorn; for all\n\tthese are in the moon. But, silence! here comes Thisbe.\n\n\t[Enter Thisbe]\n\nThisbe\tThis is old Ninny's tomb. Where is my love?\n\nLion\t[Roaring]  Oh--\n\n\t[Thisbe runs off]\n\nDEMETRIUS\tWell roared, Lion.\n\nTHESEUS\tWell run, Thisbe.\n\nHIPPOLYTA\tWell shone, Moon.

Here she comes; and\n\ther passion ends the play.\n\n\t[Re-enter Thisbe]\n\nHIPPOLYTA\tMethinks she should not use a long one for such a\n\tPyramus: I hope she will be brief.\n\nDEMETRIUS\tA mote will turn the balance, which Pyramus, which\n\tThisbe, is the better; he for a man, God warrant us;\n\tshe for a woman, God bless us.\n\nLYSANDER\tShe hath spied him already with those sweet eyes.\n\nDEMETRIUS\tAnd thus she means, videlicet:--\n\nThisbe\t          Asleep, my love?\n\tWhat, dead, my dove?\n\tO Pyramus, arise!\n\tSpeak, speak. Quite dumb?\n\tDead, dead? A tomb\n\tMust cover thy sweet eyes.\n\tThese My lips,\n\tThis cherry nose,\n\tThese yellow cowslip cheeks,\n\tAre gone, are gone:\n\tLovers, make moan:\n\tHis eyes were green as leeks.\n\tO Sisters Three,\n\tCome, come to me,\n\tWith hands as pale as milk;\n\tLay them in gore,\n\tSince you have shore\n\tWith shears his thread of silk.\n\tTongue, not a word:\n\tCome, trusty sword;\n\tCome, blade, my breast imbrue:\n\n\t[Stabs herself]\n\n\tAnd, farewell, friends;\n\tThus Thisby ends:\n\tAdieu, adieu, adieu.\n\n\t[Dies]\n\nTHESEUS\tMoonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead.\n\nDEMETRIUS\tAy, and Wall too.\n\nBOTTOM\t[Starting up]  No assure you; the wall is down that\n\tparted their fathers. Will it please you to see the\n\tepilogue, or to hear a Bergomask dance between two\n\tof our company?\n\nTHESEUS\tNo epilogue, I pray you; for your play needs no\n\texcuse. Never excuse; for when the players are all\n\tdead, there needs none to be blamed. Marry, if he\n\tthat writ it had played Pyramus and hanged himself\n\tin Thisbe's garter, it would have been a fine\n\ttragedy: and so it is, truly; and very notably\n\tdischarged. But come, your Bergomask: let your\n\tepilogue alone.\n\n\t[A dance]\n\n\tThe iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve:\n\tLovers, to bed; 'tis almost fairy time.\n\tI fear we shall out-sleep the coming morn\n\tAs much as we this night have overwatch'd.\n\tThis palpable-gross play hath well beguiled\n\tThe heavy gait of night.

If I called `fileContents.map`, it would return exactly _one_ new record for each record in _fileContents_. What I actually want instead are new records for each word-fileName combination, a significantly larger number (but the data in each record will be much smaller). \n\nUsing `fileContents.flatMap` gives me what I want. Instead of returning one output record for each input record, a `flatMap` returns a _collection_ of new records, zero or more, for _each_ input record. These collections are then _flattened_ into one big collection, another `RDD` in this case."

I don't require a type parameter after `location_contents_tuple2`, because it's inferred by Scala. The `=>` \"arrow\" separates the argument list from the body, which appears on the next few lines.\n\nWhen a function takes more than one argument or you add explicit type _annotations_ (e.g., `: (String,Int,Double)`), then you need parentheses. Here are three examples:\n\n```scala\n(some_tuple3: (String,Int,Double)) => ...\n(arg1, arg2, arg3) => ...\n(arg1: String, arg2: Int, arg3: Double) => ...\n```\nWe're letting Scala infer the argument type in our case, `(String,String)`."

I could use either braces or parentheses here. The convention in the Scala community is to use braces for a multi-line anonymous function and to use parentheses for a single expression when it fits on the same line."

I could use `RDD.map`, but I'm not changing the keys (the words), so rather than have to deal with the tuple with both elements, `mapValues` just passes in the value part of the tuple and reconstructs new `(key,value)` tuples with the new value that my function returns.

Inside the function passed to `flatMap`, I filtered for empty words immediately after splitting the contents into words and I converted to lower case as I constructed the new tuples. My choice reduces the number of output records from `flatMap` by at most one record per input line, which shouldn't have a significant impact on performance. Filtering itself adds some extra overhead. \n\nAlso, the way Spark implements steps like `map`, `flatMap`, `filter`, it would incur about the same overhead if I added an `RDD.filter` step instead. Note that we could also do the filtering later in the pipeline, after `groupByKey`, for example. So, whichever approach you implemented above is probably fine. You could do performance profiling of the different approaches, but you may not notice a significance difference until you use very large input data sets."

The `case` keyword says I want to _pattern match_ on the object passed to the function. If it's a two-element tuple (and I know it always will be in this case), then _extract_ the first element and assign it to a variable named `location` and extract the second element and assign it to a variable named `contents`.\n\nNow, instead of accessing the location and content with the slighly obscure and verbose `location_contents_tuple2._1` and `location_contents_tuple2._2`, respectively, I use meaningful names, `location` and `contents`. The code becomes more concise and more readable. \n\nThis special function syntax is called a _partial function_. It's partial in the sense that it might only handle some inputs, not all possible inputs, which would make it _total_. Partial functions have the form:\n```scala\n{                             // Opening curly brace (you can't use parentheses here)\n  case pattern1 => body1      // First pattern and body. For multi-line bodies, put on next lines.\n  case pattern2 => body2      // Second pattern and body (optional).\n  ...                         // Optional additional patterns.\n}                             // Closing curly brace.\n```\nEach record will be tested against the patterns, in order, until a match is found. In our case, we know the format will be a two-element tuple, so `case (location, contents)` matches perfectly and only one `case` clause is required. If I fail to match any of the patterns, an exception is thrown."

Instead of creating a string for the list of `(location,count)` pairs, which is opaque to our SQL schema (i.e., just a string), let's \"unzip\" the collection into two arrays, one for the `locations` and one for the `counts`. That way, if we ask for the first element of each array, we'll have nicely separate fields that work better with Spark SQL queries.\n\n\"Zipping\" and \"unzipping\" work like a mechanical zipper. If I have a collection of tuples, say `List[(String, Int)]`, I convert this single collection of \"zippered\" values into two collections (in a tuple) of single values, `(List[String], List[Int])`. Zipping is the inverse operation.\n\nHere is our final implementation, `ii1` rewritten with this change."

We use `Vector.unzip` to create a single, two element tuple, where each element is now a collection, one for the locations and one for the counts. The type is `(Vector[String], Vector[Int])`.\n\nWe can also use pattern matching with assignment! We immediately decompose the two-element tuple:\n\n```scala\n        // I use pattern matching to extract these two collections into variables.\n        val (locations, counts) = vect.unzip  \n```\n\nFinally, it's convenient to know how many locations and counts we have, so we'll compute another new column for the their count and format a four-element tuple as the final output.\n\n```scala\n        // Lastly, I'll compute the total count across all locations and return \n        // a new record with all four fields.

Not very useful if you're using this data for text searching, _sentiment mining_, etc. So called _stop words_, like _a_, _an_, _the_, _he_, _she_, _it_, etc., could also be removed.\n\nRecall the `filter` logic I added to remove \"\", `word => word.size > 0`. I could replace it with `word => keep(word)`, where `keep` is a method that does any additional filtering I want, like removing stop words.\n\n**Exercise:**\n\n* Implement the `keep(word: String):Boolean` method and change the `filter` function to use it. Have `keep` return `false` for a small, hard-coded list of stop words (make up your own list or search for one). (See the <a href=\"#ExerciseSolutions\">Appendix</a> for the solution.)"

    "source" : "## More on Pattern Matching Syntax\nWe've only scratched the surface of pattern matching. Let's explore it some more.\n\nHere's another anonymous function using pattern matching that extends the previous function we passed to `flatMap`:\n\n```scala\n{\n    case (location, \"\") => \n        Array.empty[((String, String), Int)]  // Return an empty array\n    case (location, contents) => \n        val words = contents.split(\"\"\"\\W+\"\"\")\n        val fileName = location.split(pathSep).last\n        words.map(word => ((word, fileName), 1))\n}.\n```\n\nYou can have multiple `case` clauses, some of which might match on specific literal values (\"\" in this case) and others which are more general. The first case clause handles files with no content. The second clause is the same as before.\n\nPattern matching is _eager_. The first successful match in the order as written will win. If you reversed the order here, the `case (location, \"\")` would never match and the compiler would throw an \"unreachable code\" warning for it.\n\nNote that you don't have to put the lines after the `=>` inside braces, `{...}` (although you can). The `=>` and `case` keywords (or the final `}`) are sufficient to mark these blocks. Also, for a single-expression block, like the one for the first case clause, you can put the expression on the same line after the `=>` if you want (and it fits). \n\nFinally, if none of the case clauses matches, then a [MatchError](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.MatchError) exception is thrown. In our case, we _always_ know we'll have two-element tuples, so the examples so far are fine. \n\nHere's a final contrived example to illustrate what's possible, using a sequence of objects of different types:"

Add `L` or `F`, respectively, to infer `Long` or `Float` instead.\n* Note how we mixed specific type checking, e.g., `i: Int`, with more loosely-typed expressions, e.g., `(x1, x2)`, which expects a two-element tuple, but the element types are unconstrained.\n* All the words `i`, `l`, `f`, `d`, `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, and `default` are arbitrary variable names. Yes `default` is not a keyword, but an arbitrary choice for a variable name. We could use anything we want.\n* The last `default` clause specifies a variable with no type information. Hence, it matches _anything_, which is why this clause must appear last. This is the idiom to use when you aren't sure about the types of things you're matching against and you want to avoid a possible [MatchError](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.MatchError).\n* If you want to match that something _exists_, but you don't need to bind it to a variable, then use `_`, as in the three-element tuple example.\n* The three-element tuple example also demonstrates that arbitrary nesting of expressions is supported, where the first element is expected to be a two-element tuple.\n\nAll the anonymous functions we've seen that use these pattern matching clauses have this format:\n\n```scala\n{ \n    case firstCase => ...\n    case secondCase => ...\n    ... \n}```\n\nThis format has a special name. It's called a _partial function_. All that means is that we only \"promise\" to accept arguments that match at least one of our `case` clauses, not any possible input. \n\nThe other kind of anonymous function we've seen is a _total function_, to be precise. \n\nRecall we said that for total functions you can use either `(...)` or `{...}` around them, depending on the \"look\" you want. For _partial functions_, you _must_ use `{...}`."

In a typical compiled Scala program or the Scala interpreter, it would all run in the process of the program or interpreter. That's also true when you use local mode for Spark, but _not_ when you run in a cluster.\n\nLocally and in a cluster situation, your _driver_ program (including the Spark shell) runs the `myRDD.map` code immediately, which constructs a directed, acyclic graph (DAG) of processing steps to run _later_, when you ask for results. In other words, Spark is lazy and only runs the computation on demand. So, what happens to the function passed to `map` in this case? \n\nSpark serializes the function so it can be transmitted to nodes on the cluster for execution. Even in local mode it serializes the code, even though it will be executed in the same JVM process as your driver.\n\nUsually, all this is transparent to you, but sometimes you'll write a function that can't be serialized and you'll get a `NotSerializable` exception. Spark tries to tell you what part of the function isn't serializable, but usually your function references something outside, like a field in an enclosing class, and that pulls in data structures that can't be serialized. I won't discuss this issue further here, but you can search for longer explanations and workarounds."

    "source" : "Okay, what about that `case` keyword? It tells the compiler to do several useful things for us, eliminating a lot of boilerplate that we would have to write for ourselves with other languages, especially Java:\n\n1. Treat each constructor argument as an immutable (`val`) private field of the instance.\n1. Generate a public reader method for the field with the same name (e.g., `word`).\n1. Generate _correct_ implementations of the `equals` and `hashCode` methods, which people often implement incorrectly, as well as a default `toString` method. You can use your own definitions by adding them explicitly to the body. We did this for `toString`, to format the arrays in a nicer way than the default `Array[_].toString` method.\n1. Generate an `object IIRecord`, i.e., with the same name. The object is called the _companion object_.\n1. Generate a \"factory\" method in the companion object that takes the same argument list and instantiates an instance.\n1. Generate helper methods in the companion object that support pattern matching.\n\nPoints 1 and 2 make each argument behave as if they are public, read-only fields of the instance, but they are actually implemented as described.\n\nPoint 3 is important for correct behavior. Case class instances are often used as keys in [Maps](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.collection.Map) and [Sets](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.collection.Set), Spark RDD and DataFrame methods, etc. In fact, you should _only_ use your case classes or Scala's built-in types with well-defined `hashCode` and `equals` methods (like `Int` and other number types, `String`, tuples, etc.) as keys.\n\nFor point 4, the _companion object_ is generated automatically by the compiler. It adds the \"factory\" method discussed in point 5, and methods that support pattern matching, point 6. You can explicitly define these methods and others yourself, as well as fields to hold state. The compiler will still insert these other methods. However, see <a href=\"#Ambiguities\">Ambiguities with Companion Objects</a>. The bottom line is that you shouldn't define case classes in notebooks like this with extra methods in the companion object, due to parsing ambiguities.\n\nPoint 5 means you actually rarely use `new` when creating instances. That is, the following are effectively equivalent:"

In Spark 2.0.0, `Dataset` becomes the \"parent\" class of `DataFrame`. This means that you'll be encouraged to use the greater type safety of `Dataset`, but you can still use `DataFrame` if you want. Now, `DataFrame` will be the equivalent of `Dataset[Row]`, where [Row](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/scala/index.html#org.apache.spark.sql.Row) is the loosely-typed representation of the row and its columns.\n\nIn Spark 1.6.2, it's somewhat awkward to convert between `DataFrames` and `Dataset`, but this is improved in Spark 2.0."

Unlike Java 8 interfaces, traits can also have fields representing \"state\" information about instances. There is a blury line between traits and _abstract classes_, again where some member methods or fields are not defined. In both cases, a subtype of a trait and/or an abstract class must define any undefined members if you want to construct instances of it.\n\nSo, why have both traits and abstract classes? It's because Java only allows _single inheritance_; there can be only one _parent_ type, which is normally where you would use an abstract class, but Scala lets you \"mix in\" one or more additional traits (or use a trait as the parent class - yes, confusing). A great example \"mix in\" trait is one that implements logging. Any \"service\" type can mix in the logging trait to get \"instant\" access to this reusable functionality. Schematically, it looks like the following:\n\n```scala\n// Assume severity `Level` and `Logger` types defined elsewhere...\ntrait Logging {\n\n    def log(level: Level, message: String): Unit = logger.log(level, message)\n    \n    private logger: Logger = ...\n}\n\nabstract class Service {\n    def run(): Unit   // No body, so abstract!\n}\n\nclass MyService extends Service with Logging {\n    def run(): Unit = {\n        log(INFO, \"Staring MyService...\")\n        ...\n        log(INFO, \"Finished MyService\")\n    }\n}\n```\n\n`Unit` is Scala's equivalent to Java's `void`. It actually is a true type with a single return value, unlike `void`, but we use it in the same sense of \"nothing useful will be returned\"."

It then throws an error on the opening `.` on the next line. On the other hand, the compiler keeps compiling, ignoring the new line in this case. \n\nThis notebook also does the same thing as the \"raw\" interpreter, but in some cases, notebooks will use an interpeter command, `:paste` that tells the parser to parse all of the lines that follow together, just like the compiler would parse them, until the \"end of input\", which you indicate with `CTRL-D`. \n\nYou can't experiment with it through this notebook, but your session would look something like this:\n\n```scala\nscala> :paste\n// Entering paste mode (ctrl-D to finish)\n\n(1 to 10)\n.map(i => i*i)\n<CTRL-D>\n\n// Exiting paste mode, now interpreting.\n\nres0: scala.collection.immutable.IndexedSeq[Int] = Vector(1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100)\n\nscala>\n```"

The notebook gets confused between the case class and the object. \n\nWhile unfortunate, it's also true that once you start defining more involved case classes, with more than trivial methods and explicit additions to the default companion object, you should really define these types outside the notebook in a compiled library that you use within the notebook.\n\nThe details are beyond our scope here, but basically, you set up a project with your Scala code and build it using your favorite build tool. [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) is a popular choice for Scala, but Maven, Gradle, etc. can be used. \n\nYou want to generate a _jar_ file with the compiled artifacts, then when you start `spark-shell`, submit a Spark job with `spark-submit` or use a notebook environment like this one, you specify the jar for inclusion. For `spark-shell` and `spark-submit`, invoke it with the `--jars myproject.jar` option. For Toree with Jupyter, see the discussion on the [FAQ page](https://toree.incubator.apache.org/documentation/user/faq.html)."

    "source" : "In Java, all _reference types_ are descended from [java.lang.Object](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html). The name _reference type_ reflects the fact that the instances for all these types are allocated on the _heap_ and program variables are references to those heap locations.\n\nThe primitives types, `int`, `long`, etc. are not considered part of the type hierarchy and are treated specially. This is in part a performance optimization, as instances of these types fit in CPU registers and the values are pushed onto stack frames. However, they have wrapper or \"boxed\" types, `Integer`, `Long`, etc., that are part of the type hierarchy, which you must use with Java's collections, for example (with the exception of arrays).\n\nInstead, Scala treats the primitives at the code level as basically the same as the reference types. You don't use `new Int(100)` for example, but you can call methods on `Int` instances. The code generated, in most cases, uses the optimized JVM primitives. \n\nHence, the Scala type hierarchy defines a type [Any](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/#scala.Any) to be the a parent type of _both_ reference types and \"value\" types (for the primitives). Each of those subhierarchies have parent types, [AnyRef](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/#scala.AnyRef) is effectively the same as [java.lang.Object](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html), and [AnyVal](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/#scala.AnyVal) is the parent of the value types.\n\nFinally, for better \"soundness\", the Scala type system defines a real type to represent [Null](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/#scala.Null) and [Nothing](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/#scala.Nothing). By defining `Null` to be the subtype of all reference types `AnyRefs` (but not `AnyVals`), it supports at the type level the (unfortunate) practice of using `null` for a reference value.\n\nHowever, `null` is not allowed for an `AnyVal`, so the true \"bottom type\" of the hierarchy is `Nothing`. Why is that useful. I'll explain in the next section."

An alternative is return a `Try[File]`, where the [Try](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.util.Try) encapsulates both cases in the return value, as we'll discuss next.

The only change to the body would be to simply add `Try` before the opening bracket:\n\n```\ndef curl(sourceURLString: String, targetDirectoryString: String): Try[File] = Try {...}\n```\n\nNow, the reader knows from the method signature that it might fail somehow. If a call fails, the relevant exception will be returned wrapped in a subclass of `Try`, called [util.Failure[File]](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.util.Failure). However, if `curl` succeeds, the `File` will be returned wrapped in the other subclass of `Try`, [util.Success[File]](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.util.Success).\n\nBecause of Scala's type safety, the caller of `curl` would have to determine if a `Success` or `Failure` was returned and handle it appropriately.\n\nScala does not have methods declare the exceptions they will throw using the `throws` clause, like Java. So, looking at the signature of our original version, there's no obvious way to know if it throws an exception _or_ returns `null` on failure:\n```scala\ndef curl(sourceURLString: String, targetDirectoryString: String): File = {...}\n```\n\nIf we choose to catch exceptions internally and return `null`, the caller has to remember to check for `null`. Otherwise, the infamous [NullPointerException](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/NullPointerException.html) might happen occasionally if the caller assumes a non-`null` value is returned. So, using `Try[File]` prevents us from this loophole. _It helps the user do the right thing!_\n\nAlso, using `Try` rather than simply throwing an exception, means that `curl` always returns \"normally\", so the caller maintains full control of the call stack and special exception-catching logic isn't required (although you can do that in Scala, if you want to)."

It would be a mistake to allow a user to define other subtypes, like `MaybeCouldFailButWhoKnows`, because users of `Try` in pattern matching will always want to know that there are only two possibilities. Scala adds a keyword to enforce this logical behavior. `Try` is actually declared as follows:\n\n```scala\nsealed abstract class Try[+T] extends AnyRef\n```\n\n(`AnyRef` is the same as Java's `Object` supertype.) The `sealed` keyword says that _no_ subclasses of `Try` can be declared, _except_ in the same source file (which the library author wrote). Hence, users of `Try` can't declare their own subclasses, subverting the logical structure of this type hierarchy and other user's code that relies on this structure."

This is where [Option[T]](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.Option) comes in. \n\n`Option` is analogous to `Try`, it is a `sealed` abstract type with two possible subtypes:\n\n* [Some[T]](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.None): I have a an instance of `T` for you, inside the `Some[T]`.\n* [None](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.None): I don't have a value for you, sorry.\n\nNote that a hash map is a great example where I either have a value for a given key or I don't. Therefore, for Scala's [Map[K,V]](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.collection.Map) abstraction, where `K` is the key type and `V` is the value type, the `get` method has this signature:\n\n```scala\ndef get(key: K): Option[V]\n```\n\nOnce again, you know from the type signature that you may or may not get a value instance for the input key, _and_ you **must** determine whether you got a `Some[V]` or a `None` as the result.

You will encounter this mechanism used when you read the Spark Scaladocs, even though you might never realize you're actually using it in your code!\n\nRecall I mentioned previously that you can define default values for method arguments. I just used it for the `age` argument for `Person`:\n\n```scala\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int = 0)\n```\n\nSometimes we need something more sophisticated. For example, our library might have a group of methods that need a special argument passed to them that provides useful \"context\" information, but you don't want the user to be required to explicitly pass this argument every time. Other times you might use implicit arguments to make the API \"cleaner\", but still have some control over what's allowed.\n\nHere's an example, that's partly inspired by Scala's [Seq.sum](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/#scala.collection.Seq) method. Wouldn't it be great if I happen to have a collection of things I can \"add\" together, if I could just call `sum` on the collection?

    "source" : "So, the implicit values `intAdd`, `doubleAdd`, and `stringAdd`, were used by the Scala interpreter for the `adder` argument in the second _argument list_ for `sum`. Note that you have to use a second argument list and all arguments there must be implicit. \n\nWe could have avoided using implicit arguments if we defined custom `sum` methods for every type. That would have been simpler in this trivial case, but for nontrivial methods, the duplication is worth avoiding. Another advantage of this mechanism is that the user can define her own implicit `Add[T]` instances for domain types (say for example, `Money`) and they would \"just work\".\n\nThe Scala collections API uses this mechanism to know how to construct a new collection of the same kind as the input collection when you use `map`, `flatMap`, `reduceLeft`, etc.\n\nSpark uses this pattern for [Encoders](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/scala/index.html#org.apache.spark.sql.Encoder) in  Spark SQL. Encoders are used to serialize values into the new, compact memory encoding introduced in the _Tungsten_ project (see for example, [here](https://spark-summit.org/2015/events/deep-dive-into-project-tungsten-bringing-spark-closer-to-bare-metal/)). Here's an example of creating a [Dataset](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/scala/index.html#org.apache.spark.sql.Dataset), where the `toDS` method is first \"added\" to a Scala [Seq](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/#scala.collection.Seq) through an implicit conversion (specifically [SQLImplicits.localSeqToDatasetHolder](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/scala/index.html#org.apache.spark.sql.SQLImplicits), which is brought into scope by the `import sqlc.implicits._` statement earlier) and then `toDS` uses `Encoders` internally."

Please post issues on how I can improve it to the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/deanwampler/JustEnoughScalaForSpark).\n\nNow you know the core elements of Scala that you need for using the Spark Scala API. I hope you can appreciate the power and elegance of Scala. I hope you will choose to use it for all of your data engineering tasks, not just for Spark. \n\nWhat about data science? There are many people who use Scala for data science in Spark, but today Python and R have much richer libraries for Mathematics and Machine Learning. That will change over time, but for now, you'll need to decide which language best fits your needs.\n\nAs you use Scala, there will be more things you'll want to understand that we haven't covered, including common idioms, conventions, and tools used in the Scala community. The references at the beginning of the notebook will give you the information you need.\n\nBest wishes.\n\n[Dean Wampler](mailto:deanwampler@gmail.com)<br/>\n[@deanwampler](http://twitter.com/deanwampler)"

However, as discussed previously, defining whole classes like this is usually best done in libraries that you _use_ in the notebook, where the Scala compiler handles scopes more carefully."

We can do something similar with `filter` and instead write `filter(keep)`. \n\nWhat does this mean exactly? It tells the compiler \"convert the _method_ `keep` to a _function_ and pass that to `filter`.\" This works because `keep` already does what `filter` wants, take a single string argument and return a boolean result.\n\nPassing `keep` is actually different than passing `word => keep(word)`, which is an _anonymous_ function that _calls_ keep. We are using `keep` as the function itself, rather than constructing a function that uses `keep`."
